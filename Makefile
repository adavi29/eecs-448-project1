# -- General notes about Makefiles --
# Documentation:
# https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/index.html#SEC_Contents
#
# Highlights:
# Variables in Makefiles work like C preprocessor directives: text-based
# substitution. The names are case sensitive and cannot contain :, #, =, or
# whitespace.
#
# There are four ways to assign a variable: =, :=, ::=, and ?= but
# := and ::= are equivalent to one another. Of the two only ::= is
# POSIXLY_CORRECT.
#
# = recursively expands the variable if the definition includes other variables
#     every time the variable is substituted (used)
# := is a simply expanded variable. Its value is scanned once and any expansions
#     happen at the time of assignment.
# ?= assigns a variable if it has not yet been assigned. Be aware that an empty
#     value is still an assignment.

# --- Program Name ---
FILENAME := battleship

# --- Include Dirs ---
SRCDIR := ./src
INCDIR := ./inc
OBJDIR := ./obj

# --- Debugging ---
# This is here but my recommendation is not to run it. There is a lot of lazy
# memory hacking in GTK that causes Valgrind to go a little crazy. There was
# an effort to make a list of things Valgrind should ignore and not report
# since they are GTK's fault and not yours, but it was not updated for GTK as
# far as we can tell. You will know when your program has no memory errors when
# using it does not cause it to crash.

          --show-leak-kinds=all \

# --- Compiling ---
# CXX is typically an environment variable, but just in case it happens to be
# clang, we'll enforce g++
CXX := g++

# --- Compiliing: Detect System Type to Automatically Append Paths Later ---

# --- Compiling: Set Compiler Flags
# You probably don't want to change these all by hand. Changing this is even
# quicker than using sed, Vi, or C-M-%. The shell command expands to flags that
# GTK+ requires to compile.
# -g -- Generate debugging information
# -c -- Do not run the linker
# -o -- Name the output whatever comes after
# -W -- Makes the compiler complain if you go too far off-standard
# -I$(INCDIR) -- Makes the compiler search /inc for headers -- this is good
#                because errors become informative instead of being hidden
#                behind a series of recursive includes.

# The $@ refers to the target. There's no reason to write it twice.
# $< refers to the first thing after the colon

# --- Phonies ---
# Phonies essentially declare a target as being unrelated to actual files in
# the project directory, and allow you to make files with the same name as
# such a target without worrying about aliasing commands.

rebuild: clean all

# Removes object files as well as any Emacs autosave files. "| true" (or true)
# causes rebuild to work even if there's nothing to clean. 2&>1 is a shell
# script idiom for I/O redirection. Basically, any output that would go to
# stderr (2) is redirected (>&) to stdout (1). It lets us see when rm can't find
# anything to remove. By the way, keyboard input comes through channel
# 0 (stdin)!
